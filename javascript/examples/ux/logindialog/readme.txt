About LoginDialog
===========================
This is a simple login dialog extension for Ext 2.x library

Some days ago I was looking for a nice login dialog for my web application to avoid spending time on creating one. Maybe I am blind or otherwise unfortunate and missed something - but I didn't find any that would suit my needs.

The only extension I found was Ext.ux.Domino.LoginMenu by galdaka ( http://extjs.com/learn/Extension:Domino_authentication ) but that seemed rather over complicated and not flexible enough for my simple needs. But I did take few ideas and an icon from there. (Thanks Galdaka!)

Anyway this is what I created and hope you will find it useful. It's free and open source. Would be nice if you credit me but that's up to you.

How it works
==============
Simple! You create an instance of it and pass at least 2 config options
a) the server URL where to submit form data and b) the path where the images are
stored (they are sort of optional. Doesn't break the functionality if missing)

The server has to return the response in JSON format:
{
    success : true or false,
    message : 'the message to show if login failed'
}

And that's IT! You can also customize the loginDialog to suit your needs better.
Anyway here is a small example:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/LoginDialog.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        Ext.onReady (function () {
            var loginDlg = new Ext.ux.albeva.LoginDialog({
                url : '/auth/login', // where the request is submitted to
                basePath : "/img/icons" // do not add trailing slash!
            });
        });
    </script>

Of course you need to load ExtJS library as well. The dialog has some more 
useful config options, some methods and callback events.
