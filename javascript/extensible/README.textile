<h1>Extensible</h1>

<h2>An Ext JS Component Library</h2>
<p>by Brian Moeskau</p>

<h2>Building the Source</h2>
<p>Build scripts for both Mac/Unix (<code>build/build.sh</code>) and Windows (<code>build/build.bat</code>) are included.  You must have a current version of Java installed for JSBuilder to work.  You should also edit the build script and update the path variables as needed for your system.</p>
<p>If you run the build script (e.g., "sh build.sh" in the Mac terminal, or just "build" on the Windows command line) it will build everything (minus docs), create a <code>/deploy</code> folder and also place the <code>*-all</code> files in the root folder.  The jar file for the Ext-doc tool ("http://ext-doc.org/":http://ext-doc.org/) is also included.  If you'd like to generate docs also, simply pass "-d" as a command line arg to the build script (e.g., "sh build.sh -d" or "build -d").</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you would prefer not to build the source yourself, you can also "download":http://github.com/bmoeskau/Extensible/downloads the latest available build.</p>

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
<p>Extensible requires the Ext JS framework (version 3.2 or later). By default the examples link to Ext 3.2.0 via cachefly.net.  Alternately you can download the "latest version":http://www.sencha.com/products/js/download.php of Ext JS and install Extensible in a sibling directory, adjusting the example paths as needed.</p>

<p>To use Extensible in your application simply include the Extensible JS and CSS files after the standard Ext JS includes. For example:</p>

<p><pre><code>
    <!-- Ext JS includes -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://extjs.cachefly.net/ext-3.2.0/resources/css/ext-all.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://extjs.cachefly.net/ext-3.2.0/adapter/ext/ext-base-debug.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://extjs.cachefly.net/ext-3.2.0/ext-all-debug.js"></script>

    <!-- Extensible includes -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/extensible-all.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/extensible-all-debug.js"></script>
</code></pre></p>

<p>During development you should include <code>extensible-all-debug.js</code>, but then for deployment use the minimized <code>extensible-all.js</code>.  If you are using individual source files then it's up to you to include them all, in the proper order. Look under the <code>/examples</code> folder to get a jump start on how to use the included components.</p>
