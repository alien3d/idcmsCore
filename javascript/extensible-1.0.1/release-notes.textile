h2. 1.0 (Beta 1)

_Dec. 9, 2010_

*API Changes*
* The default value for <tt>CalendarView.dateParamFormat</tt> is now 'Y-m-d' (instead of 'm-d-Y'). This was done for consistency and also because it is a more sensible default.

* Selected calendar date now persists consistently across page navigation
* Overlapping event display bug in day/week view for events < 30 minute duration
